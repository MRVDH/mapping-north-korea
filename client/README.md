## Build Setup

To do live editing:
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

To build for production:
``` bash
# run this
npm run build
# then delete the server/dist folder
# then copy the client/dist folder to the server folder. (still need to automate this)
```
