# Frontend
Vue.js setup with Vue CLI using Vuex, vue-router and more.

## Running the frontend
First install all dependencies
```
npm install
```

Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

Compiles and minifies for production (deployment triggers this, so no need to do this yourself)
```
npm run build
```
